                   <strong>Forget the measuring tape</strong>.
  Figure out your bra size yourself by looking for symptoms. 
How long has it been since you’ve changed your bra size? Many factors in
 your life can affect a change in your bra size – pregnancy, hormones, 
weight fluctuations, exercise, etc. So, throughout your life, you can 
experience 6 or more bra sizes.  All things considered, it’s probably 
worth your while to give some thought to possibly changing the size bra 
you are wearing.<br><br>
<strong>You have the judgment to figure out your bra size</strong>.  
Going to a store and having a bra fitter determine your size for you can
 be a mistake – many size incorrectly, don’t put you in a bra size 
that’s comfortable, or stick you in a bra size that is in stock rather 
than in your correct size.  You, yes YOU are the best person to figure 
out your bra size.  After all, you’re the one who’s going to have to 
wear this bra size every day.  So, simply start with your present  bra 
size, assess the things about your current bra size that you don’t like,
 and select a new size. HerRoom can help you with this.  Here are the 2 
simple steps you need to take:<br>
<br><strong>Step 1</strong> – Find your best fitting bra and put it on. 
If you like the fit, that’s your bra size (as long as that bra’s not old
 and stretched out), You are done!  If you don’t like its fit, go to 
step 2.
<br><br>
<strong>Step 2</strong> – What don’t you like about your best fitting 
bra?  Stand in front of a mirror, and make a list.  Now, take this list 
and compare it to our list of “<a href="http://www.herroom.com/bra-fitting-advice,909,30.html" class="contentx">Solutions To Bra Fit Problems</a>”.  Read our recommendations and adjust your bra size to fix what you don’t like. It’s as simple as that!
